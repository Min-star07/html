    <h1>Introduction to Deep Learning</h1>

    <h2 id="what-is-dl">1.1 What is Deep Learning?</h2>
    <p>
      Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural
      networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns
      in data. It's especially powerful for tasks such as image recognition,
      speech recognition, and natural language processing. Deep learning models
      automatically learn features from data, reducing the need for manual
      feature extraction and making them versatile for a wide range of
      applications.
    </p>

    <h2 id="Pytorch">1.2 What is PyTorch?</h2>
    <p>
      PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's
      AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph
      system, making it easy to build and modify neural networks on the fly.
      PyTorch is widely used in both academic research and production due to its
      simple, intuitive syntax and strong GPU acceleration support.
    </p>
    <p>
      PyTorch's dynamic nature allows developers to easily test and debug their
      code, making it an excellent choice for experimentation and prototyping.
      Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with other popular Python libraries
      such as NumPy and SciPy, allowing for a smooth workflow.
    </p>

    <h2 id="installation">1.3 PyTorch Installation</h2>
    <p>To install PyTorch, follow these steps:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Environment</h3>
    <p>
      PyTorch can be installed using various package managers like pip or
      through Anaconda. Choose the one that best suits your setup.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Select Your Installation Command</h3>
    <p>
      Visit the official
      <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch website</a> to
      generate the appropriate command for your system configuration, including
      your operating system, package manager, and CUDA version if GPU support is
      needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Example Installation Command</h3>
    <p>Here's an example command to install PyTorch via pip:</p>
    <pre>
# For CPU Only
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# For GPU (CUDA) Enabled Version
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
</pre
    >

    <h3>Step 4: Verify Your Installation</h3>
    <p>
      Verify your installation by running the following code in a Python
      environment:
    </p>
    <pre>
import torch
print(torch.__version__)  # Prints the installed PyTorch version
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Checks if GPU is available
</pre
    >
    <p>
      If you see the correct version of PyTorch and <code>True</code> for GPU
      availability, your installation is successful.
    </p>

    <h2 id="basic-info">1.4 Basic Information (Numpy, Tensor, and Class)</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding basic concepts such as Numpy, tensors, and classes is
      essential for working with PyTorch and deep learning:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>NumPy:</strong> NumPy is a foundational library for numerical
        computing in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and
        mathematical functions. PyTorch is designed to be interoperable with
        NumPy, allowing easy conversion between NumPy arrays and PyTorch
        tensors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tensors:</strong> Tensors are the core data structure of
        PyTorch, similar to NumPy arrays but with additional capabilities for
        GPU acceleration. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that can store
        data of any type, and they are used for all data manipulations in
        PyTorch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Classes:</strong> In PyTorch, classes are used to define models
        (neural networks). A model in PyTorch is typically a subclass of
        <code>torch.nn.Module</code>, and the forward pass of the network is
        defined within this class. Understanding how to define and work with
        classes is crucial for building and training custom models.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This basic information will help you understand the fundamental building
      blocks of deep learning and how to effectively use PyTorch for model
      development.
